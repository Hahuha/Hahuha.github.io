        Bonjour, I’m Valentin ! I’m a junior developer from <a href="http://www.ipponusa.com/">Ippon Technologies</a>, in Paris. I graduated mid-2015 and
        discovered that there is still a lot to learn during your career (like, a lot !). So, on my free-time,
         I try to learn some new libraries, languages and other cool stuff. Whatever is about <span class="highlight">Java</span>, <span class="highlight">J2EE</span>,
        <span class="highlight">HTML/CSS</span> and <span class="highlight">Javascript</span>. My code is not perfect but I’m trying to keep it simple (hence the title) in order to maximize
         maintainability and readability.
      </p>
      <h2><span>Where am I, what is this ?</span></h2>

        Well, <u>this</u>, as you say, is a little something I did to improve my front-end skills, especially in Sass.
        The idea emerged the day I discovered we could <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/">create a static blog</a> in GitHub using Jekyll.
        It the opportunity I needed to try Sass and create a beautiful and responsive design.
        But, the fact is that I'm more of a developer than a UI/UX designer. Gladly, I had help from colleagues who gave me great
        advices and helped me choose the fonts and create a color palette (Two of the hardest things when you're new to webdesign).
        So, a big thank you to Omar, Thomas and Faten !
      </p>

        Now, about the blog itself. I don't really now if I'm going to write articles and stuff but it might be good for me to write
        explanations about problems I had or technologies Im learning. My point is that writing an article where I have to explain
        something to people will contribute to make it clearer to myself and help me not forget it.

        As you can see on the homepage, there are two categories of post on this blog : Articles and Projects
