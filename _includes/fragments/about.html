        Well, <u>this</u>, as you say, is a little something I did to improve my front-end skills, especially in Sass.
        The idea emerged the day I discovered we could <a href="#">create a static blog</a> in GitHub using Jekyll.
        It the opportunity I needed to try Sass and create a beautiful and responsive design.
        But, the fact is that I'm more of a developer than a UI/UX designer. Gladly, I had help from colleagues who gave me great
        advices and helped me choose the fonts and create a color palette (Two of the hardest things when you're new to webdesign).
        So, a big thank you to Omar, Thomas and Faten !

        Now, about the blog itself. I don't really now if I'm going to write articles and stuff but it might be good for me to write
        explanations about problems I had or technologies Im learning. My point is that writing an article where I have to explain
        something to people will contribute to make it clearer to myself and help me not forget it.
