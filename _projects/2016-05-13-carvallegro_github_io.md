A technical blog about all kind of stuff but mainly Javascript, CSS and JavaEE environment
It’s a little something I did for fun, to try out Sass and learn more about JavaScript.

## Jekyll, a simple but complete static site generator

The creation of this blog started from a completely random thought : for a long time I wondered how it was possible that some blogs had a _​github.io_ domain name. Was it a favor from GitHub to special users or companies ? The answer is waaay more simple : Github allow anyone to have a blog, just by creating a repository and using Jekyll.

GitHub has, once again, did it right. You just have to create a repository named ``[username].github.io``​ and either create an index.html file (very basic)
or simply use Jekyll to create something more complex. Push your result on master and it is live !

I won’t write a course about how to create and configure a Jekyll blog, the Jekyll team did a [perfect job](jekyll_official) with this and there is a very strong community who offers a lot of tips to customize it to your needs. I will only say that GitHub does not allow much plugins. For a list of all the plugins, see this [GitHub Page](jekyll_plugins).

## This blog looks fancy, but...

It needs to be said, I am not a designer but a developer over all. But I do find design fascinating and have a lot of respect for all the designer.
Although it might seems like they’re only playing with pencils and Photoshop (artists, you know), their job is harder than it seems.
I think that anyone who has ever tried to do a good­looking website will understand me when I say that I struggled for days only to choose which fonts and which colors for this blog.

I have the chance to have colleagues who are talented designers and were willing to help me. They did not design it for me but gave me great advices, a huge thanks for them !

I’m quite proud of my work so far with the UI/UX, it’s still a work in progress and need a few adjustments and I need to know when to stop. I will try to respect the [May 1st Reboot](may_reboot) as much as I can, obviously not every year because I don’t want to relapse in the nightmare that designing is for me.
